      "How many times have we found ourselves rearranging all the plugs over and over in order to add a new electronic on the power strip?",
      "Also, a very usual issue we found is that the space between outlets is not enough to fit in different size plugs at the same time.",
      "Another common problem is the shape and size of these power strips, they are often too big and bulky and designed in a way that does not adapt to its surroundings, so instead of modifying the product to our needs is occurring otherwise.",
      "In addition to all mentioned before, we have that a lot of energy is wasted because of all the devices plugged at the same time, even those that are not in use.",
      "The solution we see in almost every power strip is a main button that turns off all outlets, but this is not the correct answer to the energy waste issue, the correct solution would be a possibility to turn off the different outlets independently, so you can  reduce energy consumption in a selective way.",

      "This junction is achieved entirely by magnets which eliminates the complexity in its use and does not limit the array of outlets in one way, but allows them to arrange in the most optimal manner in harmony with the context.",

      "The electric current is passed from one module to another by electromagnetic induction, where there is a main module that connects to a wall outlet and the rest are free modules that connect consecutively, so there is no need for extra cable connections that may entangle.",

      "There was a similar product on the market that was a solid piece shaped to fit snugly on the bottom of the fence whereas the one I was thinking about slid directly under the fence line and folded up.",
      "Some of the feedback I received  on my version of the weed-block defense shield was that a lot of older fences may already be buried into the ground and it would make it much more difficult to dig up the ground and put the shield on; so I thought of a much easier way to solve this problem and I hope you agree this is another good solution to trimming the edges and not worry about the your edgers string getting caught in the fence and snapping.",
      "Not only will this be decorative for any yard but it will be easy to install with a little assistance.",
      "The panels are obviously smooth on both sides and  the back sides will have snaps on the back.",
      "The snaps will clamp together through the holes on the fence.",
      "This will allow for less work.",
      "1) You don't need to dig to get under neath the fence.",
      "2) You don't need to struggle to pull the fence up.",
      "3) You don't need to worry about getting the string caught in the fence or snapping and backfiring.",
      "4) You use less string which means saving money."

      "Many parts of the US - and the world in general - are currently in a serious drought status including many coastal regions that have an abundance of undrinkable and unusable seawater available.",
      "What is needed is a distilling process that can either be done on a broad commercial scale or on a small scale where every home has one.",
      "Quirky of course deals in consumer products, so the small-scale home version will be the most appropriate here.",
      "Note the proposed solar powered desalinator/purifier can be used for camping or at the beach too.",
      "What is proposed is a solar-powered water desalinator/purifier that works on a novel principle of percolating seawater or dirty water from a metal plate that's heated by sunlight.",
      "However, the process involves fast evaporation and not necessarily boiling of the seawater.",
      "Sunlight enters the desalinator's evaporization-chamber and heats a metal plate that has many upward-facing, small-diameter vertical channels.",
      "Sunlight entering at the top of the evaporization-chamber strikes the metal plate resulting in water molecules \"percolating\"  from the tops of the great multitude of plate-channels.",
      "An electric fan whose dc motor is powered by the solar cell draws air into the evaporization-chamber to keep the humidity level low, and it also causes the air pressure bearing down on the surface of the metal plate to remain low so the evaporation process speeds up dramatically.",
      "The evaporate (evaporated water or water vapor) is then drawn from the evaporization-chamber and is forced by the fan through a drip screen where it condenses and falls into a container below.",
      "So it's the novel action of the electric fan combined with the percolation of water through channels in the metal plate that results in very rapid evaporation of the seawater.",
      "The distilling process removes fresh water from the seawater by evaporating (or boiling) it away while leaving the salt and other contaminants in the brine at the bottom of the evaporizing-chamber.",
      "Please see the drawing.",
      "This works!"

      "-pillow the air more on the sides of the head (next to the ears), like pontoons, and would have less air pillowed behind the neck; this design would allow the chin to raise and head to tilt-back slightly, which in turn would encourage the chest and feet to rise in the water, making it easier to float."

      "However, portable mobile device chargers use an outlet to supply power to an internal battery... My idea is simpler, the objective is to use a stroking motion to spark a charge from the counter rotation of a DC motor/generator, it then supplies power to a 3volt battery, which powers a second DC motor to motorize the yoke connected on the DC electric generator, the power or electricity charged by the unit is stored into both a 3volt and 9volt ion battery until used to recharge a product, its a 12 volt self stored self generated charging capacity for any emergency.",

      "The idea is to rotate the motor and the generator simultaneously to begin the initial charge.",
      "That will then store electricity into the smaller battery which will supply power to the motor.",
      "Afterwards this motor will independently rotate the generator to supply electricity into the larger battery for personal use.",
      "its not perpetual motion, but its better than having to use manually, gas powered or having to connect to an outlet for charging when urgency.",

      "The vast majority of residential recessed (can light) reflectors are highly inefficient light reflectors, because they are designed to be used with reflector style incandescent reflector bulbs that  typically have a narrower beam that funnels a lot of their light directly out of the fixture without hitting the reflector.",
      "This combination works reasonably well.",
      "The problem is however, that incandescent reflector bulbs are expensive and use a lot of power!",
      "To save money on bulbs and power, inexpensive spiral CFLs or lower wattage standard bulbs can be used instead.",
      "However, light from a spiral CFLs or standard light bulbs radiates in all directions, causing about half of the light to get \u201ctrapped\u201d inside the highly inefficient reflector, creating low brightness, low contrast, washed out lighting.",
      "In photometric tests, CFL reflector bulbs unfortunately perform nearly the same as regular spiral CFLs in can lights.",
      "The Bulb Mate is a revolutionary new type of reflector for your recessed lights.",
      "It simply clips over your old reflector in seconds, anyone can do it.",
      "Its patented ultra lightweight micro-optical film design lets you use low cost power-saving standard bulbs or spiral CFLs and get bright radiant lighting with up to triple the brightness and double the efficiency, with a look similar to expensive and power hungry incandescent reflector spot bulbs.",
      "With lower power bills and no more expensive reflector bulbs to buy, it quickly pays for itself, and pays you every time you replace bulbs.",
      "It's portable too, just take it with you if you move.",
      "The Bulb Mate  reflector was designed specifically for spiral CFLs, LED A-Lamps, or standard light bulbs.",
      "Our patented micro optical film reflection cone condenses the 360 degree light into a narrow beam, directing it out of the fixture with very few reflections, creating unmatched efficiency (up to 87%) and brightness.",
      "The narrow beam also directs the light to where its needed: in the bottom 2/3 of the room, not wasted in the upper 1/3.",
      "The net result is that a cheap, low wattage, energy efficient bulb can get you the high brightness, dramatic, punchy, high contrast lighting like incandescent reflector bulbs do, and that makes your space\u2026.. well, look and feel better!"
