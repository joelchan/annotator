The thermodynamic study indicated that the\nPNP adsorption was a spontaneous endothermic process. Furthermore, the\nsimultaneous removal for PNP and Pb(II) by Fe/Zn-biochar was\ninvestigated. It implied that the adsorption of PNP and Pb(II) at their\nlow concentration might be enhanced by the complexing-bridging mechanism\nof PNP and Pb(II) ascribing to the affinity between PNP and hydrophobic\nsites, in addition to the affinity between Pb(II) and oxygen-containing\nhydrophilic sites on Fegn-biochar surface. However, the predominated\ncompetition between PNP and Pb(II) at their high concentrations with\nFe/Zn-biochar suppressed their adsorption. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All\nrights reserved."

    "allText": "The practical implementation of hybrid rocket motors has historically\nbeen hampered by the slow regression rate of the solid fuel. In recent\nyears, the research on advanced injector designs has achieved notable\nresults in the enhancement of the regression rate and combustion\nefficiency of hybrid rockets. Following this path, this work studies a\nnew configuration called double-tube characterized by injecting the\ngaseous oxidizer through a head end injector and an inner tube with\ninjector holes distributed along the motor longitudinal axis. This\ndesign has demonstrated a significant potential for improving the\nperformance of hybrid rockets by means of a better mixing of the species\nachieved through a customized injection of the oxidizer. Indeed, the CFD\nanalysis of the double-tube configuration has revealed that this design\nmay increase the regression rate over 50\\% with respect to the same\nmotor with a conventional axial showerhead injector. However, in order\nto fully exploit the advantages of the double-tube concept, it is\nnecessary to acquire a deeper understanding of the influence of the\ndifferent design parameters in the overall performance. In this way, a\nparametric study is carried out taking into account the variation of the\noxidizer mass flux rate, the ratio of oxidizer mass flow rate injected\nthrough the inner tube to the total oxidizer mass flow rate, and\ninjection angle. The data for the analysis have been gathered from a\nlarge series of three-dimensional numerical simulations that considered\nthe changes in the design parameters. The propellant combination adopted\nconsists of gaseous oxygen as oxidizer and high-density polyethylene as\nsolid fuel. Furthermore, the numerical model comprises Navier-Stokes\nequations, k-epsilon turbulence model, eddy-dissipation combustion model\nand solid-fuel pyrolysis, which is computed through user-defined\nfunctions. This numerical model was previously validated by analyzing\nthe computational and experimental results obtained for conventional\nhybrid rocket designs. In addition, a performance analysis is conducted\nin order to evaluate the influence in the performance provoked by the\npossible growth of the diameter of the inner fuel grain holes during the\nmotor operation. The latter phenomenon is known as burn through holes.\nFinally, after a statistical analysis of the data, a regression rate\nexpression as a function of the design parameters is obtained."

    "allText": "To develop higher yielding and better adapted chickpeas, various\nbreeding programs currently use a limited number of multi-location\ntrials as a surrogate for the target population of environments (TPE).\nThese TPEs have, however, not been adequately characterised, resulting\nin some uncertainty about the true representativeness of these surrogate\nlocations as selection environments. We used the Agricultural Production\nSystems slMulator (APSIM) model to characterise the Northern Grains\nRegion of Australia, which is a major TPE of chickpea, for drought and\nthermal regimes. The model was first evaluated for its ability to\nsimulate phenology, dry matter and yield of three new\ncommercially-relevant chickpea varieties including PBA Boundary, PBA\nHatTrick and PBA Seamer. The model was then used to simulate dynamic\nchanges in water stress quantified through the supply demand ratio, and\nyield of the highest yielding genotype PBA Boundary from 1900 to 2014 at\n45 locations within the region. Water stress, and maximum, minimum and\nmean temperature patterns were derived through cluster analysis of\nrespective averages computed for every 100 Cd-omicron from 900\nCd-omicron before flowering, to 900 Cd-omicron after flowering. The\nNorthern Grains Region TPE was characterised by four types of water\nstress patterns and five types each of maximum, minimum and mean\ntemperatures patterns. Ward's cluster analysis of the percentile ranks\nof simulated seasonal yield resulting from agro-climatic variability of\nthe different locations enabled identification of eight unique\nagro-ecological regions within the TPE. Locations within each\nagro-ecological region were geographically contiguous and had highly\nharmonised annual variability in yield compared to locations of other\nagro-ecological regions. Overall, the identified agro-ecological regions\nwere fairly homogenous with respect to drought and thermal regimes and\ncould be treated as separate sub-TPEs. We argue that selecting locations\nwithin an agro-ecological region should assist breeding for locally\nadapted genotypes. In contrast, selecting locations distributed across\nagro-ecological regions could improve the broad adaptation of chickpea.\nCrown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The Pearson product-moment\ncorrelation coefficient (Pearson's R) was used to confirm significance\nof the results. Measurements showed that for an 18-s HDC pulse, the mean\n(coherent) component of the specular arrival decreased by as much as 5\ndB as root mean square (rms) surface roughness increased, whereas the\n0.5-s PAS pulse echoes showed no correlation with roughness. The\nstandard deviations of the mean levels were used to examine the\nincoherent (scattered) component of the specular arrivals. The\nincoherent component of the specular arrival increased with the product\nof the surface correlation length and the square of the rms roughness, for both HDC and PAS, with the PAS data having a 1-dB higher standard\ndeviation. A normal mode propagation model and a rough surface\nscattering model used in conjunction with a simple model that accounts\nfor coherence loss from the matched filter were successfully used to\ninterpret the results."

Contact\nforce between the impactor and the beam is obtained using the\nconventional Hertz law. The field equations are derived via the Ritz\nbased applied to the total energy of the system. The solution is\nobtained in the time domain by implementing the well-known Runge-Kutta\nmethod. After examining the validity of the present solution, the\neffects of distribution of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), nanotube volume\nfraction, core-to-face sheet thickness ratio, initial velocity of the\nimpactor and the impactor mass are studied in detail. Finally, it is\nconcluded that, the highest peak contact force and the lowest\nindentation of the top face sheet belong to the sandwich beam with V\ndistribution figure of face sheet, followed by the UD and A-ones, respectively. Also, numerical results reveal that employing FG-CNTs in\nface sheets has a prominent role on impact response of the sandwich\npanel with soft core. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

    "allText": "Control moment gyros (CMGs) are a widely used device for generating\ncontrol torques for spacecraft attitude control without expending\npropellant. Because of its effectiveness and cleanness, it has been\nconsidered to be mounted on a space structure for active vibration\nsuppression. The resultant system is the so-called gyroelastic body.\nSince CMGs could exert both torque and modal force to the structure, it\ncan also be used to simultaneously achieve attitude maneuver and\nvibration reduction of a flexible spacecraft. In this paper, we consider\nthe singularity problem in such application of CMGs. The dynamics of an\nunconstrained gyroelastic body is established, from which the output\nequations of the CMGs are extracted. Then, torque singular state and\nmodal force singular state are defined and visualized to demonstrate the\nsingularity. Numerical examples of several typical CMGs configurations\non a gyroelastic body are given. Finally, a steering law allowing output\nerror is designed and applied to the vibration suppression of a plate\nwith distributed CMGs."
