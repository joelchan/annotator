Recent insights into novel fabrication methodologies and electrochemical techniques have resulted in the demonstration of chemical sensors able to augment conventional physical measurements (i.e. heart rate, EEG, ECG, etc.), thereby providing added dimensions of rich, analytical information to the wearer in a timely manner. Wearable electrochemical sensors have been integrated onto both textile materials and directly on the epidermis for various monitoring applications owing to their unique ability to process chemical analytes in a non-invasive and non-obtrusive fashion. In this manner, multi-analyte detection can easily be performed, in real time, in order to ascertain the overall physiological health of the wearer or to identify potential offenders in their environment. Of profound importance is the development of an understanding of the impact of mechanical strain on textile- and epidermal (tattoo)-based sensors and their failure mechanisms as well as the compatibility of the substrate employed in the fabrication process. We conclude this review with a retrospective outlook of the field and identify potential implications of this new sensing paradigm in the healthcare, fitness, security, and environmental monitoring domains. With continued innovation and detailed attention to core challenges, it is expected that wearable electrochemical sensors will play a pivotal role in the emergent body sensor networks arena.",

Current diagnosis of shunt malfunction is imprecise and involves neuroimaging studies and shunt tapping, an invasive measurement of intracranial pressure and shunt patency. These patients often present emergently and a delay in care has dire consequences. A microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) patency sensor was developed to enable direct and quantitative tracking of shunt patency in order to detect proximal shunt occlusion prior to the development of clinical symptoms thereby avoiding delays in treatment. The sensor was fabricated on a flexible polymer substrate to eventually allow integration into a shunt. In this study, the sensor was packaged for use with external ventricular drainage systems for clinical validation. Insights into the transduction mechanism of the sensor were obtained. The impact of electrode size, clinically relevant temperatures and flows, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plasma sterilization on sensor function were evaluated. Sensor performance in the presence of static and dynamic obstruction was demonstrated using 3 different models of obstruction. Electrode size was found to have a minimal effect on sensor performance and increased temperature and flow resulted in a slight decrease in the baseline impedance due to an increase in ionic mobility. However, sensor response did not vary within clinically relevant temperature and flow ranges. H2O2 plasma sterilization also had no effect on sensor performance. This low power and simple format sensor was developed with the intention of future integration into shunts for wireless monitoring of shunt state and more importantly, a more accurate and timely diagnosis of shunt failure.",

This paper presents a numerical study on stretch-induced wrinkling of hyperelastic thin sheets based on nonlinear finite element analyses. The model problem is set up for uniaxial stretching of a rectangular sheet with two clamped ends and two free edges. A two-dimensional stress analysis is performed first under the plane-stress condition to determine stretch-induced stress distribution patterns in the elastic sheets, assuming no wrinkles. As a prerequisite for wrinkling, development of compressive stresses in the transverse direction is found to depend on both the length-to-width aspect ratio of the sheet and the applied tensile strain in the longitudinal direction. A phase diagram is constructed with four different distribution patterns of the stretch-induced compressive stresses, spanning a wide range of aspect ratio and tensile strain. Next, an eigenvalue analysis is performed to find the potential buckling modes of the elastic sheet under the prescribed boundary conditions. Finally, a nonlinear post-buckling analysis is performed to show evolution of stretch-induced wrinkles. In addition to the aspect ratio and tensile strain, it is found that the critical condition for wrinkling and the post-buckling behavior both depend sensitively on the sheet thickness. In general, wrinkles form only when both the magnitude and the distribution area of the compressive stresses are sufficiently large. The wrinkle wavelength decreases with increasing strain, in good agreement with the prediction by a scaling analysis. However, as the tensile strain increases, the wrinkle amplitude first increases and then decreases, eventually flattened beyond a moderately large critical strain, in contrast to the scaling analysis.",

The kirigami design was tested on constituent materials including non-stretchable copy papers and highly stretchable silicone rubber to explore the role of constituent material properties. The cut unit in the shape of solid rectangles with the square shape as a special case was demonstrated for achieving the extreme stretchability via rigid rotation of cut units. We found that compared to the square cut units, the theoretically predicted maximum stretchability via unit rotation in rectangle units (aspect ratio 2:1) increased dramatically from about 41% to 124% for the level 1 cut structure without hierarchy, and from about 62% to 156% for the level 2 hierarchical cut structure, which was validated by both experiments and simulations. To demonstrate the achievement of both extreme stretchability and compressibility, we replaced the solid square cut units with porous squares and re-entrant lattice shapes in silicone rubber based metamaterials. We found that a porous structure can enable an extreme compressibility of as high as 81%.",

Several strategies exist to program materials to change from one shape to another; however, few can temporally and spatially control the shape. Programming the sequence of shape transformation with temporal control has been driven by the desire to generate complex shapes with high yield and to create multiple shapes from the same starting material. This paper demonstrates a markedly simple strategy for programmed self-folding of two-dimensional (2D) polymer sheets into 3D objects in a sequential manner using external light. Printed ink on the surface of the polymer sheets discriminately absorbs light on the basis of the wavelength of the light and the color of the ink that defines the hinge about which the sheet folds. The absorbed light gradually heats the underlying polymer across the thickness of the sheet, which causes relief of strain to induce folding. These color patterns can be designed to absorb only specific wavelengths of light (or to absorb differently at the same wavelength using color hues), thereby providing control of sheet folding with respect to time and space. This type of shape programming may have numerous applications, including reconfigurable electronics, actuators, sensors, implantable devices, smart packaging, and deployable structures.",

      "In this\npaper, in order to fully understand mechanisms of phase distribution and\nliquid-phase turbulence modulation in the horizontal channel bubbly\nflow, the influence of gravity level on both of them were investigated\nin detail with the developed Euler-Lagrange two-way coupling method.",
      "For\nthe present investigation, the buoyance on bubbles in both sides of the\nchannel always points to the corresponding wall in order to study the\nliquid-phase turbulence modulation by bubbles under the symmetric\nphysical condition.",
      "The present investigation shows that the gravity\nlevel has the important influence on the wall-normal distribution of\nbubbles and the liquid-phase turbulence modulation; the higher the\ngravity level is, the more bubbles can overcome the wall-normal\nresistance to accumulate near the wall, and the more obvious the\nliquid-phase turbulence modulation is.",
      "It is also discovered that\ninterphase forces on the bubbles are various along the wall-normal\ndirection, which leads to the fact that the bubble located in different\nwall-normal places has a different wall-normal velocity."

By employing a space-time network representation in\nthe formulations, this complex train scheduling and control problem with\ndynamic passenger demands is rigorously formulated into two optimization\nmodels with linear forms. The first model is an integer programming\nmodel that jointly minimizes train traction energy consumption and\npassenger waiting time. The second model, which is formulated as a\nmixed-integer programming model, further considers the utilization of\nregenerative braking energy on the basis of the first model. Due to the\ncomputational complexity of these two models, especially for large-scale\nreal-world instances, we develop a Lagrangian relaxation (LR)-based\nheuristic algorithm that decomposes the primal problem into two sets of\nsubproblems and thus enables to find a good solution in short\ncomputational time.

Any decrease in SMC could worsen soil water\nshortage in both the top and deep soil layers, further endangering the\nsustainability of the fragile ecosystem. This study analyzed the\nvariations in SMC following the conversion of croplands into forests in\nthe Loess Plateau. SMC data within the 5-m soil profile were collected\nat 50 sites in the plateau region via field survey, long-term in-situ\nobservations and documented literature. The study showed that for the 50\nsites, the depth-averaged SMC was much lower under forest than under\ncropland. Based on in-situ measurements of SMC in agricultural plots and\nC korshinskii plots in 2004-2014, SMC in the 0-4 m soil profile in both\nplots declined significantly (p < 0.01) during the growing season. The\nrate of decline in SMC in various soil layers under C korshinskii plots\n(-0.008 to -0.016 cm(3) cm (-3) yr(-1)) was much higher than those under\nagricultural plots (-0.004 to -0.005 cm(3) cm(-3) yr(-1)). This\nsuggested that planting C. korshinskii intensified soil moisture decline\nin China's Loess Plateau. In the first 20-25 yr of growth, the depth\n-averaged SMC gradually decreased with stand age in R. pseudoacacia\nplantation, but SMC somehow recovered with increasing tree age over the\n25 -year period. Irrespectively, artificial forests consumed more deep\nsoil moisture than cultivated crops in the study area, inducing soil\ndesiccation and dry soil layer formation. Thus future afforestation\nshould consider those species that use less water and require less\nthinning for sustainable soil conservation without compromising future\nwater resources demands in the Loess Plateau.

In this Letter, we formulate a model for the dynamic hysteresis based on the idea that the cell accumulates a huge quantity of surface electronic charge at forward bias that is released on voltage sweeping, causing extra current over the normal response. The charge shows a retarded dynamics due to the slow relaxation of the accompanying ionic charge, that produces variable shapes depending on scan rate or poling value and time.

However, Ti-6Al-4V parts made by selective laser melting (SLM) often suffer from poor ductility and low toughness because of the predominant acicular alpha' martensite contained in columnar prior-beta grains. In practice, post heat treatment is necessary. To overcome this deficiency, we have explored designing innovative SLM processing routes to turn the unfavoured alpha' martensite, via in-situ decomposition, into lamellar (alpha+beta) microstructures with tuneable characteristic length scales. Such lamellar (alpha+beta) microstructures lead to superior mechanical properties which markedly exceed ASTM standards and outperform the majority of Ti-6Al-4V fabricated by other additive manufacturing processes. Furthermore, we find that the lattice parameter of the beta phase in the (alpha+beta) lamellae falls into a specific range of 3.18-3.21 angstrom. Hence the lattice parameter of beta phase can serve as an indicator to predict whether significant martensite decomposition has taken place in situ in Ti-6Al-4V made by SLM.

Distributed optimization algorithms, e.g., alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), suitable for\nconstrained optimization problems, have been proposed in the previous\nliterature to develop distributed architecture. In this article, we show\nthat Prony analysis, a non-constrained least square estimation (LSE)\nproblem, can be solved using the classic data fusion approach. Compared\nto the iterative distributed optimization algorithms (e.g., ADMM and\nsubgradient methods), data fusion takes only one step.

This\napproach leads to a distributed Prony analysis architecture which\nrequires a much less demanding communication system (the bandwidth can\nbe less than 0.1 Hz) compared to the conventional centralized Prony\nanalysis for multiple channels which requires a bandwidth of 30 Hz. The\napplication discussed in this paper is to identify oscillation modes\nfrom real world phasor measurement unit (PMU) data and further\nreconstruct signals. A key technical challenge to implement Prony\nanalysis for signals from multiple channels is the difficulty to\nidentify the noise characteristics of each channel. In this paper, a\nmethod is proposed to identify the noise covariances, which leads to the\nconstruction of a weighted least square estimation (WISE) problem.
