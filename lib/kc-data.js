In this\npaper, in order to fully understand mechanisms of phase distribution and\nliquid-phase turbulence modulation in the horizontal channel bubbly\nflow, the influence of gravity level on both of them were investigated\nin detail with the developed Euler-Lagrange two-way coupling method. For\nthe present investigation, the buoyance on bubbles in both sides of the\nchannel always points to the corresponding wall in order to study the\nliquid-phase turbulence modulation by bubbles under the symmetric\nphysical condition. The present investigation shows that the gravity\nlevel has the important influence on the wall-normal distribution of\nbubbles and the liquid-phase turbulence modulation; the higher the\ngravity level is, the more bubbles can overcome the wall-normal\nresistance to accumulate near the wall, and the more obvious the\nliquid-phase turbulence modulation is. It is also discovered that\ninterphase forces on the bubbles are various along the wall-normal\ndirection, which leads to the fact that the bubble located in different\nwall-normal places has a different wall-normal velocity."

    "allText": "Advances in wireless technologies, low-power electronics, the internet of things, and in the domain of connected health are driving innovations in wearable medical devices at a tremendous pace. Wearable sensor systems composed of flexible and stretchable materials have the potential to better interface to the human skin, whereas silicon-based electronics are extremely efficient in sensor data processing and transmission. Therefore, flexible and stretchable sensors combined with low-power silicon-based electronics are a viable and efficient approach for medical monitoring. Flexible medical devices designed for monitoring human vital signs, such as body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, blood pressure, pulse oxygenation, and blood glucose have applications in both fitness monitoring and medical diagnostics. As a review of the latest development in flexible and wearable human vitals sensors, the essential components required for vitals sensors are outlined and discussed here, including the reported sensor systems, sensing mechanisms, sensor fabrication, power, and data processing requirements.\n"

Mobile communications and social media are hugely important to the development of these performers\u2019 careers, opening access to collaborators, production tools, audiences and distribution channels. This group go to extraordinary lengths to gain and maintain access to these technologies, often by exploiting their social capital through musical and ethnic networks. We document that even after nearly twenty years of democracy, a ridged separation along racial lines persists, which can be seen in all areas of life including access to and proficiency in digital technologies. We these divisions both on and offline in order to distinguish themselves from other artists. Our research raises a number of implications for post-colonial computing, highlighting difficulties related to discontinuous access, and how international preconceptions of identity and authenticity emerge as a consequence of increased use of communication technology."
