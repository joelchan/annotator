    "allText": "The device efficiency of polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction solar cells has recently surpassed 11%, as a result of synergistic efforts among chemists, physicists, and engineers. Since polymers are unequivocally the heart of this emerging technology, their design and synthesis have consistently played the key role in the device efficiency enhancement. In this article, the first focus is a discussion on molecular engineering (e.g., backbone, side chains, and substituents), then the discussion moves on to polymer engineering (e.g., molecular weight). Examples are primarily selected from the authors contributions; yet other significant discoveries/developments are also included to put the discussion in a broader context. Given that the synthesis, morphology, and device physics are inherently related in explaining the measured device output parameters (J(sc), V-oc and FF), we will attempt to apply an integrated and comprehensive approach (synthesis, morphology, and device physics) to elucidate the fundamental, underlying principles that govern the device characteristics, in particular, in the context of disclosing structure-property correlations. Such correlations are crucial to the design and synthesis of next generation materials to further improve the device efficiency."

We built Echo, a smartphone application for recording everyday experiences and reflecting on them later. We conducted three system deployments with 44 users who generated over 12,000 recordings and reflections. We found that TMR improves well-being as assessed by four psychological metrics. By analyzing the content of these entries we discovered two mechanisms that explain this improvement. We also report benefits of very long-term TMR."

This will exacerbate the already high cost incurred by utility companies and communities due to damage to distribution systems by hurricanes. Consequently, long-term investment in critical civil infrastructure systems, such as distribution systems, requires long-term planning that incorporates the potential impact of climate change. This can only be achieved through a comprehensive risk analysis framework for evaluating the impact of climate change and studying the effectiveness of various adaptation strategies. This paper presents a framework for incorporating the potential impact of climate change in the reliability analysis of power distribution systems subject to hurricane hazards. The framework incorporates a time-dependent hurricane hazard model, time-dependent fragility model, system reliability evaluation, and a life cycle cost analysis for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various climate change adaptation strategies. A notional power distribution system located in the hurricane-prone state of Florida is used to demonstrate the proposed framework. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers."

By leveraging the Chebyshev basis functions of MCPI, interpolation in 1 dimension may be used to target plane crossing events, instead of integrating the 42 dimensional variational equation required for standard step integrators. This results in dramatically improved performance over traditional differential correctors. MCPI was tested against the Runge-Kutta 7/8 integrator on over 45,000 halo orbits in three different three-body problems, and was found to be up to an order of magnitude faster, while simultaneously increasing robustness."

Applications include wearable consumer electronics, soft robotics, medical prosthetics, electronic skin, and health monitoring. In this review, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of the emerging flexible and wearable sensing platforms for healthcare and biomedical applications. We first introduce the selection of flexible and stretchable materials and the fabrication of sensors based on these materials. We then compare the different solid-state and liquid-state physical sensing platforms and examine the mechanical deformation-based working mechanisms of these sensors. We also highlight some of the exciting applications of flexible and wearable physical sensors in emerging healthcare and biomedical applications, in particular for artificial electronic skins, physiological health monitoring and assessment, and therapeutic and drug delivery. Finally, we conclude this review by offering some insight into the challenges and opportunities facing this field."

Topological architectures are common in nature and can be seen, for example, in DNA molecules that condense and relax during cellular events1. Synthetic topological nanostructures, such as catenanes and rotaxanes, have been engineered using supramolecular chemistry, but the fabrication of complex and reconfigurable structures remains challenging2. Here, we show that DNA origami3 can be used to assemble a Mbius strip, a topological ribbon-like structure that has only one side4, 5, 6.
