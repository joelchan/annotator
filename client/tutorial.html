            <p>We are a building a computer model that can help us understand how products work and how they relate to each other. In particular, we want to understand 2 things about each product:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><label>Its <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span></label>: What unique problem is the product designed to solve?</li>
                <li><label>Its <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span></label>: What function(s) and/or component(s) of the product allow(s) it to achieve its purpose?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Your task is to read a product description and do two things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Summarize the <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span> and <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span> of the product.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Annotate the description to mark the individual words that best signal the <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span> and/or <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span> of the product. Mark a word by clicking on it and selecting the appropriate keyword type (e.g., purpose or mechanism). You may mark as many words as you think will help.

                    <h4>Example</h4>
                    <p>Here is an example of what we would like you to do.</p>
                    <p>On the left is a product description, which we have already annotated. Purpose keywords are marked like <span class="key-purpose">this</span> and mechanism keywords are marked like <span class="key-mechanism">this</span>.</p>
                    <p>On the right are two textboxes for summarizing the product's <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span> and <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span>. We have also filled these out here so you can see examples of what we mean by <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span> and <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span>.</p>

                        <p>I want to make a suntime.</p>
                        <p>There is no device now on the market that <span class="key-purpose">records</span> the <span class="key-purpose">intensity</span> and <span class="key-purpose">time</span> of day that sunshine falls on any selected location.</p>
                        <p>Suntime does this.</p>
                        <p>There are two different solar meters now for sale on Amazon that to attempt to provide a more limited amount of this information.</p>
                        <p>One is called Luster Leaf 1875 Rapitest Suncalc Sunlight Calculator and one is called Plumstone 200 SunStick Starter Pack.</p>
                        <p>These are both shown on the Amazon website.</p>
                        <p>The reviews on each make clear their limitations.</p>
                        <p>Suntime has advantages over each of these because it <span class="key-purpose">records</span> the <span class="key-purpose">intensity</span> of <span class="key-purpose">sun exposure with</span> the <span class="key-purpose">time</span> of day of that exposure, provides a <span class="key-purpose">permanent</span> paper record and operates with <span class="key-purpose">no batteries</span> or <span class="key-purpose">electronics</span>.</p>
                        <p>Suntime is composed of 3 items:</p>
                        <p>A 12 hour <span class="key-mechanism">wind up timer</span> with a <span class="key-mechanism">rotating shaft</span> that unwinds clockwise with a (6” diameter?) plastic disc fixed to its upper surface.</p>
                        <p>The timer shaft extends through the disc surface and is fitted with an engagement collar.</p>
                        <p>A <span class="key-mechanism">recording annular disc</span> of <span class="key-mechanism">photosensitive (cyanotype) paper</span>, replaced after each use.</p>
                        <p>This is adhered to the timer disc and centered on the shaft on the scribed location.</p>
                        <p>The paper has a <span class="key-mechanism">printed clock</span> on its surface calibrated to the rotation time of the timer.</p>
                        <p>An opaque plastic rotating disc (6” diameter by 1/8 thick?), with a narrow open window or slit (½” by 1/16” wide?) located on a radial line near the outer edge.</p>
                        <p>The disc has a centrally located raised socket that fits loosely on the timer shaft engagement collar.</p>
