            <p>We are a building a computer model that can help us understand how products work and how they relate to each other. In particular, we want to understand 2 things about each product:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><label>Its <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span></label>: What unique problem is the product designed to solve?</li>
                <li><label>Its <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span></label>: What function(s) and/or component(s) of the product allow(s) it to achieve its purpose?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Your task is to read a product description and do 2 things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Summarize the <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span> and <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span> of the product.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Annotate the description to mark the individual words that best signal the <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span> and/or <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span> of the product. Mark a word by clicking on it and selecting the appropriate keyword type (e.g., purpose or mechanism). You may mark as many words as you think will help.
                </li>

                    <p>Here is an example of what we would like you to do.</p>
                    <p>On the left is a product description, which we have already annotated. Purpose keywords are marked like <span class="key-purpose">this</span> and mechanism keywords are marked like <span class="key-mechanism">this</span>.</p>
                    <p>On the right are two textboxes for summarizing the product's <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span> and <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span>. We ahve also filled these out here so you can see examples of what we mean by <span class="key-purpose">purpose</span> and <span class="key-mechanism">mechanism(s)</span>.</p>
